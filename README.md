## 16:198:520 : Project 2 : Circle of Life
The purpose of this project is to build a probabilistic model of an environment in the presence of uncertainty, and
use it to inform and direct decision making. You are pursuing a prey object, while simultaneously being pursued
by a predator object, and want to capture your target and evade capture yourself. This will be complicated by not
necessarily being able to see where the predator and prey are - but you must use the information you have to make
the most informed decisions you can about what to do.

Concepts used:
Breadth First Search
Markov Decision Process
Conditional Probability Models
